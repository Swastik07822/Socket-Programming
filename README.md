# Socket-Programming
Discord Server 



Socket Programming Project
This project demonstrates a simple client-server model using socket programming in Python. The server listens for incoming client connections, and the clients can send and receive messages to/from the server.

Introduction
This project showcases a basic socket programming example in Python using the TCP protocol. It consists of a server and a client application. The server listens for incoming connections from clients, and clients can communicate with the server by sending and receiving messages. The primary goal is to understand how network communication works at a low level using sockets.

Features
Server can handle multiple clients simultaneously using threading.
Clients can send messages to the server and receive responses.
Supports basic error handling and logging.
Prerequisites
Python 3.x
Basic knowledge of Python programming
Understanding of socket programming concepts
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/socket-programming.git
cd socket-programming
Install required dependencies:

This project uses only the Python standard library, so no additional dependencies are required.

Usage
Running the Server
Navigate to the server directory:

bash
Copy code
cd server
Run the server script:

bash
Copy code
python server.py
Running the Client
Navigate to the client directory:

bash
Copy code
cd client
Run the client script:

bash
Copy code
python client.py
Follow the prompts to send messages to the server.

Code Structure
server/server.py: Contains the code for the server application.
client/client.py: Contains the code for the client application.
README.md: Documentation for the project.
Examples
Start the server by running server.py.
Start multiple clients by running client.py in separate terminal windows.
Clients can send messages like "Hello, Server!" and receive responses.
